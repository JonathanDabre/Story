Hey I'm on main branch, there are two branches now lets see what happens? 
Ig this is first change in main after creating another branch.
Ig we are also about to test merge. Let's see what happens. 
But what if changes in same text file then after merge what will be the result?
here we created a different file so the scenario becomes simple after merge.
But what if changes existing files?

Improvement from GrpProj account(testing fork on git)
